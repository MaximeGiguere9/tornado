Tornado is a small project made for the Conjure Monthly Game Jam pilot. With limited scope, this project is based on a single mechanic and offers a minute of gameplay. 

Control a tornado as it causes destruction around it. The player spawns with randomly generated objects, and moves a tornado around a limited play area. The tornado can grab the objects, causing them to orbit around it. The more objects orbiting around the tornado, the larger the score combo becomes. Realeasing the objects sends them flying, and "cashes in" the accumulated combo.

The controls are limited to directional axes (WASD or left joystick) and a single button (Space or A).
