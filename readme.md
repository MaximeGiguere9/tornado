Taifuu Damashii

TLDR : move a tornado around, grab things and throw them in a whirlpool

Play as a tornado that makes landfall. As it travels over land, the tornado loses strength. Going back in the water near the whirlpool replenishes strength. The tornado can become enraged by holding a button. While enraged, strength drains faster, and objects on land are uprooted. Uprooted objects orbit the tornado as long as it is enraged. Releasing the button makes objects fall around it.

Putting uprooted objects in the whirlpool accumulates score. Score increases as more items are thrown in close succession.Generate combos by holding and throwing large amounts of items. The game ends when all items are gathered, time reaches zero or the tornado runs out of strength.
